description: How to run the Antigravity Lead Processor
---

To process the current sample leads and generate acquisition emails:

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 /Users/jansindelovsky/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/antigravity-agency/processor.py
```

The script will read data from `leads_sample.json` and output the results directly to the console in JSON format.
